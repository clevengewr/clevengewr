<h1>Wesley Clevenger</h1>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a software developer based in Rockwall, Texas. I have an appetite for learning and a passion for creating software and web applications that help make human lives a little bit easier. </p>
<p>I am a recent graduate from Stephen F. Austin State University. During my time there, I focused on learning the syntax for various coding languages.</p>
<p>I took an interest in web development and earned a web development certificate from SFA. When it comes to computers, I know a bit of everything.</p>

<h3>My Passion</h3>
<p>I think that creating computer programs is a discipline of both Science and Art merged together in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>Building user-oriented software applications is more than that though, it's a mixture of technical excellence and two-way communication between the client and the developer.</p>

<h3>My Skills</h3>
<p>Proficient in Java, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS, C++</p>
<p>Working knowledge in C, C#, COBOL, Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual Studio, Unix, Linux systems, bash scripting, and Git</p>
