            <h3>My Passion</h3>
            <p>I think that creating computer programs is a discipline of both Science and Art merged together in perfect harmony. Building user-oriented software applications is more than that though, it's a mixture of technical excellence and two-way communication between the client and the developer.</p>

            <h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a software developer based in Rockwall, Texas. I have an appetite for learning and a passion for creating software and web applications that help make human lives a little bit easier. I am a recent graduate from Stephen F. Austin State University. During my time there, I focused on learning the syntax for various coding languages. I took an interest in web development and earned a web development certificate from SFA. When it comes to computers, I know a bit of everything.</p>
