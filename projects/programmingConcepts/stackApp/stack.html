<h2>Stack Data Structure</h2>

<p>
A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. 
It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, like a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.
This program stores the filenames for the different ball color images in a stack which are used to display them on the screen.  
</p>
<p>
By clicking the push button, the user can add the selected color ball to the top of the stack.
By clicking the pop button, the user can remove the top of the stack.
The program also keeps track of the top of the stack which can be viewed using the peek button. 
If the user attempts to peek the empty stack the program will return the empty stack message.
